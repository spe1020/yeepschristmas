# Images Directory

Place your Yeeps logo and other images here.

## Logo Setup

1. **Add your Yeeps logo** to this directory as `yeeps-logo.png`
   - The logo should have a transparent background (PNG format)
   - Recommended size: 400-600px wide for best quality
   - The logo will be automatically resized for different screen sizes

2. **Logo is used in:**
   - Header (top navigation) - smaller size
   - Welcome section (main page) - larger size

## File Format

- **Format**: PNG with transparent background
- **Recommended dimensions**: 600px wide (height will scale proportionally)
- **File name**: `yeeps-logo.png`

## Alternative Formats

If you have the logo in a different format:
- SVG: Best for scaling, update the `src` path to `/images/yeeps-logo.svg`
- JPG: Works but won't have transparency, update to `/images/yeeps-logo.jpg`
